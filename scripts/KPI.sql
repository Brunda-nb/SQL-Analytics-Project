# ðŸ“Š KPI Script Overview

This SQL script is designed to generate a **one-stop summary of key performance indicators (KPIs)** from the `gold_fact_sales`, `gold_dim_product`, and `gold_dim_customers` tables.  

It provides both **big-picture metrics** and **business health indicators** in a single query using `UNION ALL`.

## âœ… What it Calculates

- **Total Sales** â€“ overall revenue generated  
- **Total Quantity** â€“ total items sold  
- **Average Price** â€“ average sales amount across all transactions  
- **Total Orders** â€“ number of unique orders  
- **Total Products** â€“ count of distinct products sold  
- **Total Customers** â€“ total unique customers  

---

## ðŸ’¡ Advanced KPIs

- **Average Order Value (AOV)** â†’ `Total Sales Ã· Total Orders`  
- **Orders per Customer** â†’ `Total Orders Ã· Customers`  
- **Repeat Customer %** â†’ % of customers who placed more than one order  
- **Top Selling Product (by Revenue)** â†’ best performer in terms of sales  
- **Top Country (by Revenue)** â†’ leading geography based on customer sales  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Why this Matters  

This script is essentially a **KPI Dashboard in SQL** â€“ instead of running multiple queries, you get all the **core business insights in one result set**.  

- Helps executives track **business health at a glance**  
- Forms the **baseline layer** for dashboards in Tableau / Power BI  
- Ensures consistency by centralizing all KPI definitions in one place
